# chervil
Computational Human Endogenous RetroVIral Labeling is a pipeline and analytical tool for detection of endogenous retroviral expression features that correspond to current or previous viral infection. 

## What is chervil and why do we need it?
Human Endogenous Retroviral Elements (hERVs) are typically latent in the human genome. However, previous work suggests that some hERVs become actively transcribed upon viral infection. Chervil uses differential expression analysis of hERVs in healthy and infected popuations (e.g. RNA-seq) in an attempt to develop a diagnostic tool for detection of pre-symptomatic or historic viral infection. 

Chervil builds on an exisiting pipelins built for hERV detection (RetroSpotter) and adds on a machine learning component to identify patterns in hERV expression specific to distinct viral infections.
