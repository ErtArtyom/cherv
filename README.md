# chervil
A detection platform for endogenous retroviral expression features that correspond to current or previous viral infection. 

## What is chervil?
Human Endogenous Retroviral Elements (hERVs) are typically latent in the human genome. However, previous work suggests that some hERVs become actively transcribed upon viral infection. Chervil uses differential expression analysis of hERVs in healthy and infected popuations (e.g. RNA-seq) in an attempt to develop a diagnostic tool for detection of pre-symptomatic or historic viral infection. 

Chervil builds on an exisiting pipelins built for hERV detection (RetroSpotter) and adds on a machine learning component to identify patterns in hERV expression specific to distinct viral infections.

### RetroSpotter Plus
1) Utilize RetroSpotter to identify differentially expressed hERVs in infected populations
2) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm to identify classifiers of hERVS specific to viral infection

### Novel Pipeline
1) Create new pipeline for RNAseq analysis using Rsubread 
2) Apply Machine Learning Algorithm to identify classifiers of hERVS specific to viral infection
